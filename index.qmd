Hi there! My name is Laura Bandi and I am a first-year PhD student in Psychological Science at Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU) studying under the supervision of Dr. Alyssa Counsell in the Psychology And Statistics Education Research (PASER) Lab.

When I'm not PhD-ing, you can find me perfecting my chocolate chip cookie recipe, taking off on a last minute trip, or curating playlists to match my every mood and activity.

**Research Interests**

-   Differences in post-secondary students' statistical literacy skills across education levels and fields of study

-   Post-secondary students' self-efficacy in learning statistics, attitudes towards statistics, and statistics anxiety

-   Improving statistics and research methods courses in the social sciences

-   Psychometrics and scale development

-   Scholarship of teaching and learning

-   Mathematics resiliency
